00:00.000 --> 00:11.350
Hello, I'm Michael cool. I am a principal engineer with Intel and also co-Chair of the W3C Web of Things Working Group.

00:11.350 --> 00:18.560
As we're working on standards to bring Web technology to the Internet of Things.

00:18.560 --> 00:25.990
And feel the Internet of Things is a very important technology for the smart city.

00:25.990 --> 00:31.940
And it also that Web technologies are important technology for the smart city.

00:31.940 --> 00:41.800
So we've been working for several years on some standards that we feel fill us in some critical gaps in the ecosystem for IoT.

00:41.800 --> 00:46.000
And I want to talk about how these relate to the smart city.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.880
So I prepared a presentation, and I'm going to now switch to that and walk through some slides.

00:51.880 --> 00:59.560
So now I want to talk about the Web of Things in the Smart City.

00:59.560 --> 01:10.020
As I mentioned, the Web of Things is a W3C Working Group that is working on adapting Web technologies to the IoT.

01:10.020 --> 01:19.640
Now, there are many many standards in IoT, and in fact there're so many that it's very confusing and a lot of competing standards.

01:19.640 --> 01:28.500
So we didn't want to add confusion by doing yet another, you know, independent vertical stack competing with all the rest.

01:28.500 --> 01:33.300
Instead we wanted to target a gap in the ecosystem.

01:33.300 --> 01:42.560
And that gap we felt was a common format for describing what an IoT service provides, how to use it.

01:42.560 --> 01:53.020
And the standard that we've already published is basically a machine readable documentation or metadata

01:53.020 --> 01:57.880
that describes how to use an IoT service, independent of protocol.

01:57.880 --> 02:11.300
And this is called the Thing Description, and it provides a high level abstract interface for talking to IoT devices terms of Properties, Actions and Events.

02:11.300 --> 02:18.850
Properties are state, actions are verbs at things you can do, and events are things can happen.

02:18.850 --> 02:20.130
You get notified about.

02:20.130 --> 02:24.090
It's very simple, high level set of interactions.

02:24.090 --> 02:32.170
And the Thing Description lets you map those to underlying protocols, but synch in terms of these high level operations.

02:32.170 --> 02:37.420
Now, we have since working on new things.

02:37.420 --> 02:41.220
So the Thing Description describes how device works.

02:41.220 --> 02:43.600
We're now working on Discovery

02:43.600 --> 02:49.810
which is a secure mechanism to find Thing Descriptions

02:49.810 --> 02:55.000
and typically doing that in an ad-hoc fashion so maybe you can get a mobile device

02:55.000 --> 03:00.820
and you're in a mall and you want to find out IoT services for the sake of accessibility.

03:00.820 --> 03:07.260
So you do discovery to do that, to find services in your location.

03:07.260 --> 03:15.200
The other issue I'd look at was to limit the scope of TDs for particular contexts.

03:15.200 --> 03:23.750
So maybe in a smart home, we want to limit the set of implementation requirements.

03:23.750 --> 03:27.930
So that a hub can do it, can do just what it needs to do.

03:27.930 --> 03:31.000
So we're also working on, on that.

03:31.000 --> 03:40.980
So we're in our second round right now, our charter, and we are close to finishing up discovery and some updates to the Thing Description model.

03:40.980 --> 03:47.210
Now I'm going to show you now a brief example of a Thing Description to make this concrete.

03:47.210 --> 03:55.450
So it is actually a very simply file that contains information.

03:55.450 --> 03:58.010
Two kinds of information.

03:58.010 --> 04:01.230
It describes what you can do.

04:01.230 --> 04:07.050
What are the Properties, Events and Actions you can interact with the device.

04:07.050 --> 04:11.090
And then the details how you use each of the interactions.

04:11.090 --> 04:15.290
So how you can use the particular protocol

04:15.290 --> 04:20.200
tools, for example, read or write the Property or invoke an Action.

04:20.200 --> 04:29.050
how to format the data or interpret the data that comes from the divice

04:29.050 --> 04:32.250
and finally what the security requirements are

04:32.250 --> 04:39.380
TD is not about distributing the security information. It's about saying what the requirements are.

04:39.380 --> 04:45.850
So that you know what need to do assuming you have the rights.

04:45.850 --> 04:55.460
And I also wanted to say Thing Description is actually an instance of linked data.

04:55.460 --> 04:58.010
which connects to the Semantic Web.

04:58.010 --> 05:04.200
So all the tools of the Semantic Web are available to describe the semantics.

05:04.200 --> 05:11.070
And actually various other activities going on to, for example, have classes of devices.

05:11.070 --> 05:23.880
to identify units, to identify geolocation, that can be used in Semantic Web to make very clear definitions of what the semantics of the device is.

05:23.880 --> 05:30.760
So, the usage patterns of Thing Descriptions are quite varied.

05:30.760 --> 05:36.890
One example is you can use it to simplify ingestion of data into a database.

05:36.890 --> 05:41.210
So may have a database in the cloud, you may have many devices from different vendors.

05:41.210 --> 05:45.600
How do you get all that data from all those devices into a common database.

05:45.600 --> 05:57.130
Well, you can use Things Description to describe each source of data, and its data schema, and then use that to parse and interpret the data and convert it into your database.

05:57.130 --> 06:02.800
Perhaps you want to put a user interface on a mobile device.

06:02.800 --> 06:10.330
So again, the descriptions of the data can be used to create appropriate visualizations of that data.

06:10.330 --> 06:20.060
And you could also use the event descriptions to know what kind of notifications at a mobile device could subscribe to from the IoT services.

06:20.060 --> 06:32.330
perhaps want to provide a service, mobile service, perhaps for accessibility. Maybe someone can call an elevator, or can open a door.

06:32.330 --> 06:39.360
And so you could do this with direct Thing to Thing interaction using a direct discovery.

06:39.360 --> 06:46.920
The other thing I wanted to say is that devices don't even have to know about Web of Things to participate.

06:46.920 --> 06:53.800
You could write a Thing Description for an existing device that's already installed, brownfield devices.

06:53.800 --> 06:58.200
Without modifying the device, you can describe how to talk to it.

06:58.200 --> 07:03.410
And as long as something else can get the Thing Description for that device, it can then talk to it.

07:03.410 --> 07:06.630
So this lets you compliment existing devices.

07:06.630 --> 07:16.510
You can do more if you start from scratch and design device for Web of Things, but you can also use Web of Things for existing devices.

07:16.510 --> 07:22.700
Now, I want to talk very briefly about some use cases.

07:22.700 --> 07:36.480
We have a quite large use case document that has been collecting submissions from many stakeholders to try to explain and clarify the requirements of different use cases.

07:36.480 --> 07:56.160
One of the things we want to get out of this workshop and about the possible IG is a sense of the priorities, which from those use cases, and also the detailed requirements for each of them, but I'll just give a few examples, drawn from those use cases.

07:56.160 --> 08:06.660
Suppose here is a distributed energy management system. And you maybe have, you know, solar panels and batteries and grid and so forth.

08:06.660 --> 08:15.220
And you would like to, because maybe the batteries are low and the sun isn't shining very bravely. You want to reduce the demand.

08:15.220 --> 08:23.000
So you would like to send IoT devices, a request, they reduce their energy consumption for time.

08:23.000 --> 08:36.670
So, but maybe of 1000 different kinds of devices. How do you unify? Unified commands for all these different devices. How to reduce their energy consumption? How do you monitor the energy consumption?

08:36.670 --> 08:53.920
So if you have the Things Description that describes all these different devices and how they gave data, or had actions relative to this, and you tagged it with appropriate semantics, then you could automatically generate these commands to a unified way.

08:53.920 --> 09:04.730
Suppose you want to do air quality management, and you have many kinds of sensors and pollution monitors and airflow systems in your city.

09:04.730 --> 09:13.550
You could again right things for sons that can unify the semantics for all those as you pull that information into a database for analysis.

09:13.550 --> 09:30.860
Similar considerations apply the traffic and logistics and also things like land and water management, where you might have different kinds of sensors for occupancy of traffic spots for flow of water, and so forth.

09:30.860 --> 09:37.130
One that was submitted recently was cultural space management.

09:37.130 --> 09:41.480
You might have various requirements in, say, a museum

09:41.480 --> 09:53.220
to make sure that humidity and occupancy and security are under control and protected to be displayed, and to have people be comfortable.

09:53.220 --> 10:04.420
Public transportation, you might have various kinds of services available to people, to let them know when buses are coming, or to call a bus or so forth.

10:04.420 --> 10:08.330
And it's also relates to accessibility.

10:08.330 --> 10:13.350
If you have people who are mobility impaired or visually impaired or hearing impaired.

10:13.350 --> 10:18.200
They can request different kinds of services to make things accessible to them.

10:18.200 --> 10:28.660
So for example, able to call an elevator, open the door or get guidance if they're visually impaired in place of signage and so forth.

10:28.660 --> 10:32.940
So anyways, there's many, many use cases that we can imagine.

10:32.940 --> 10:36.380
The question is, what are the priorities for the cities,

10:36.380 --> 10:41.820
what are the places that really lack solutions in the market and have gaps

10:41.820 --> 10:51.770
where a standard would help unify and make it easier and more efficient for the vendors and the cities to work together on creating the solutions.

10:52.750 --> 11:02.080
So if you want to follow up with us, I am a co-Chair, so my parter is Sebastian Kaebisch, who is from Siemens.

11:02.080 --> 11:06.600
And we're both working on this for many years.

11:06.600 --> 11:09.220
I'm also pointing here at the Web site.

11:09.170 --> 11:12.570
Ah, at top much more information.

11:12.570 --> 11:18.550
If you'd like more information, the slide deck includes links to various documents.

11:18.550 --> 11:22.280
And these links in particular all pointing at the editors drafts,

11:22.280 --> 11:26.480
but I'd like to direct you to particular the use case document,

11:26.480 --> 11:29.730
which discusses many of use cases that we've already talked about

11:29.950 --> 11:40.950
And also for anything else, you can go to the main Web site, www.w3.org/WoT,

11:40.950 --> 11:44.060
where we have also links to all the above information.

11:44.060 --> 12:40.730
Thanks very much!

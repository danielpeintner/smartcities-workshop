Hello welcome to my presentation about Standardized Service Orchestration in Smart City. 
My name is Sebastian Käbisch and I‘m from Siemens Technology. 
Pedram and I submitted this talk to the W3C Smart City Workshop 2021. 
Ok, let‘s start!


Slide 2
00:00:18.900 --> 00:01:38.700
Smart City scenarios typically consist of an interplay of multiple heterogeneous Things. 
A special situation in Smart City is that you have Things providers that are owned by 
private sectors such as car and eScooter sharing service providers or by operators 
from the public sector such as public transportation or traffic signals. 

In many applications it is desired to orchestrate different data sources and functions 
from such service offerings to different smart city application scenarios. Here we 
can mention “Monitoring” and “Controlling” scenarios, for example observing and act in 
critical situations such as flooding in a city area. 
AI can be used, for example, to predict traffic jams or overcrowding situations if 
there is a football match and to propose different traffic routing and the increase of 
public transportation service on that day. 

Realizing such different smart city applications is quite challenging. 
This is based on the fact that the different IoT assets come typically with their 
own interfaces with specific data models, protocols and security conditions. This 
diversity results in high implementation and maintenance costs over the years.

Slide 3
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:49.700
Questions arise as to how we can challenge this diversity in smart cities scenarios? 
And how can we simplify service orchestration?

Slide 4
00:01:49.900 --> 00:03:15.700
We believe that an answer to this question is relying on open standards. Why you 
should do so? Lets take as example the W3C as a well known SDO. 
 
As you know the Web is a very successful story. A lot of business is going on there and 
through the last years this development has further massively increased. One of the reasons 
why that is so successful is, Web application can be simply realized based on standardized 
technology building blocks that follow specifics Web API, data formats and semantics. Based on 
a common understanding service orchestration can be realized easily and reused to simply 
create new value added services especially for costumers.  
Now, it would be cool to have something similar for the Internet of Things. 
 
And the great thing is, the W3C has setup a group which takes care of this and has started 
to standardize building blocks for the IoT. If you are interested in some more details 
about WoT and the building blocks please checkout the presentation from Michael McCool with 
the title “The Web of Things in the Smart City” or visit the official WoT webpage www.w3.org/WoT

Slide 5
00:03:15.900 --> 00:04:30.100
Here you can see an example, how the Web of Things building block can be applied to 
the smart city scenarios in an abstract manner. 

The WoT Thing Description can provide a common description for the different IoT 
asset interfaces. This helps to understand what the asset offers, which data model 
is used and what the communication & security setup looks like. Having such Thing Descriptions, 
this helps to simply onboard the different IoT assets and simplifies the 
interaction with the assets. Another great building block that WoT offers is an 
application layer that consists in what we called properties, actions events.
 
Typically, all what can be offered by the IoT assets can be reflected by those 3 
interaction affordances. This abstraction is a great thing since this allows developers only 
to work with the properties, actions and events paradigm and do not have to take care anymore 
of the communication details like protocols and security setups. This enables rapid service 
orchestration and is future-oriented by being more extensible and flexible, It also increases 
the reusage of existing implementations and libraries. 
 
Slide 6
00:04:30.500 --> 00:05:09.100
Siemens already uses Web of Things in different Siemens products. Our commercial 
implementation is called sayWoT and is a professional solution to realize smart city 
scenarios as mentioned before. sayWoT helps to have an easy integration of the different IoT 
assets and enables a rapid service orchestration. A costumer, e.g., uses sayWoT to control and 
monitor around 3000 Things which serve in total 750-thousend datapoints. If you are interested 
in getting more information about sayWoT we would be happy to receive a message from you.

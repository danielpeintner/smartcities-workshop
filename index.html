        <section>
          <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
          <p>These days Smart Cities topic is getting more and more popular and there are expectations for smarter and easier integration of various technologies from multiple vendors related to IoT devices and Web services specifically with the current COVID-19 situation.</p>

          <p>On the other hand, several <a hre="https://w3c.github.io/wot-usecases/#smart-city">use cases on Smart Cities</a> have been discussed within the Web of Thing (WoT) IG as part of the WoT standardizaton based on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/ws-2019/minutes.html#day2-item02">proposal during the Second WoT Workshop in Munich</a>.</p>

          <p>However, Smart Cities topic include various technologies and WoT is just one of those technologies. Therefore we would like to create a dedicated W3C Interest Group:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>to identify and document use cases and requirements that W3C specifications need to meet to support Smart City services,</li>
              <li>to obtain feedback from all stakeholders on the usage of Web technologies for Smart Cities,</li>
              <li>to gather expert input on important features for Smart Cities based on the Web technology, and</li>
              <li>to provide a forum for technical and business discussions related to Smart Cities.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>We've generated an <a href="http://w3c.github.io/wot/charters/smart-cities/smart-cities-ig-charter.html">initial draft Charter for the expected Smart Cities Interest Group</a>. However, we would like to collect even more use cases along with concrete system implementation experiences from all over the world, because Smart Cities topic depends on the cities' locations, cultures, etc., and include various sub-systems from many different vendors. Therefore we'd like to hold a dedicated W3C workshop on the possible standardization for Smart Cities.</p>

          <p>Please note that cities include diverse populations including people with disabilities. So we have to guarantee accessibility as well as security, privacy protection and multi-language support and security for Smart Cities.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
          <p>The Web has become a platform for various industries and services including payments and commerce, publishing, media distribution, video conferencing and connected cars, and it's becoming a promising platform for IoT interoperability as mentioned in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/04/pressrelease-wot-rec.html.en">Web of Things Press Release in April 2020</a>.) Also there is an expectation for the Web of Things standards to be applied to integration of huge numbers of sub-systems for Smart City services. Therefore we've been generating a <a href="http://w3c.github.io/wot/charters/smart-cities/smart-cities-ig-charter.html">draft Charter for the expected Smart Cities Interest Group</a> to (1) introduce the W3C as a place to have discussions on interoperability for Smart City services and (2) document use cases and requirements that W3C specifications need to meet to support Smart City services.</p>

          <p>Now we would like to improve and finalze the description of the <a href="http://w3c.github.io/wot/charters/smart-cities/smart-cities-ig-charter.html">draft IG Charter</a> by holding a dedicated W3C workshop to see what can be done with the existing Web standards and what is still missing that would help people to implement Smart Cities.</p>

          <p>The goals of the workshop are:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Identify the stakeholders of Smart Cities standardization to drive the development of Web standards aligned with the real needs of Smart Cities</li>
              <li>Clarify reasonable applications for Smart Cities we agree to build</li>
              <li>and then see how to improve the <a href="http://w3c.github.io/wot/charters/smart-cities/smart-cities-ig-charter.html">draft Charter for the expected Smart Cities Interest Group</a> for further discussions within the expected IG</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Please note that Smart Cities applications are tightly related to the people live in the cities, and potentially would have negative impacts on their lives. So it is very important to discuss inclusive design including accessibility, privacy and security as well as internationalization.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 id="topics">Topics</h2>
          <p>Possible topics for the workshop should include:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Summary of the current status of Smart Cities:
                  <ul>

                  </ul>
              </li>

                  </ul>
              </li>

              <li>Cross-cutting issues for integration of multiple sub-systems:
                  <ul>
                      <li>accessibility, internationalization, security and privacy</li>
                      <li>Trust of the data</li>
                      <li>Discovery of resources</li>
                      <li>Semantic interoperability of the data described in different data formats/models</li>
                      <li>High-speed network environment for realtime interaction</li>
                      <li>Semantics and syntax definition by taxonomy and ontology</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
          </ul>

        <!--
        <section>
          <h2 id="viewpoint">Important viewpoints for Smart City discussion</h2>

          <p>In addition to the possible topics above, the following points are tightly related to Smart City services in general, and very important not only from the viewpoint of IoT technologies but also the viewpoint of Smart City as the city-wide service infrastructure, e.g., free broadband connection everywhere:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Security and privacy</li>
              <li>Accessibility and usability</li>
              <li>Internationalization and compatibility with region-specific issues</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Therefore those points should be discussed for all the topics during all the workshop sessions to incorporate design-for-all thinking throughout all aspects of the Smart City infrastructure, e.g., to ensure accessibility for people with disabilities in every activity and at every stage of life and to resolve internationalization issues including both technical ones and legal/policy ones.</p>

          <p>Specifically, "Privacy for Smart Cities" should be a dedicated topic of the workshop to discuss the potential challenges on the question of "Can the Smart Cities operate in manner that respects end users and citizens?". For that purpose, we would like to get participants in the workshop from not only technologies but also legal and civil society participants.</p>

          <h2 id="examples">Examples of possible use cases</h2>
          <p>The possible use cases for Smart Cities should include integration of many devices and sub-systems developed by different vendors, and also should be considered from various stakeholders' viewpoints.</p>

            <p>
                W3C is a voluntary standards consortium that convenes companies and
                communities to help structure productive discussions around existing
                and emerging technologies, and offers a Royalty-Free patent framework
                for Web Recommendations. We focus primarily on client-side (browser)
                technologies, and also have a mature history of vocabulary (or
                “ontology”) development. W3C develops work based on the priorities of
                our members and our community.
